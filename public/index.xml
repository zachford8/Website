      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>Introduction: The two datasets that I have chosen to two use are both from the National Football League (NFL). One of which has attendance data for each football teams from 2000-2019 and the other dataset has standings statistics for each football teams from 2000-2019. I acquired these two datasets through the website github.com. The variables that are within the attendance dataset are team, team name, year, total overall attendance for the year, total home attendance for the year, total away attendance for the year, the week of the season, and attendance for that week whether it was home or away.</description>

      <description>0. Introduction  The dataset that I am using for this project contains data on different shots that were taken during different games of the 2014-2015 NBA season. I found this dataset on www.kaggle.com. Some notable variables within the dataset are winorlose, which determines if the game was won-W or lost-L. shot_number is current number of shots that a player has taken in that specific game. Another variable is dribbles, which is the amount of dribbles the player took before the shot.</description>
