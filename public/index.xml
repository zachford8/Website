      <description>Using python in RStudio Think about the last time you were using RStudio and needed to use python so you could be able to run regular expression on your data. Well, the time has come all thanks to the reticulate package and reading through this post. The first step is to read in the reticulate package just like you would with any other R package. Also, in order for this to work properly you must be using an R Markdown document.</description>

      <description>1) Introduction: The two datasets that I have chosen to use are both from the National Football League (NFL). One of which has attendance data for each football teams from 2000-2019 and the other dataset has standings statistics for each football teams from 2000-2019. I acquired these two datasets through the website github.com. The variables that are within the attendance dataset are team, team name, year, total overall attendance for the year, total home attendance for the year, total away attendance for the year, the week of the season, and attendance for that week whether it was home or away.</description>

      <description>0. Introduction The dataset that I am using for this project contains data on different shots that were taken during different games of the 2014-2015 NBA season. I found this dataset on www.kaggle.com. Some notable variables within the dataset are winorlose, which determines if the game was won-W or lost-L. shot_number is current number of shots that a player has taken in that specific game. Another variable is dribbles, which is the amount of dribbles the player took before the shot.</description>
